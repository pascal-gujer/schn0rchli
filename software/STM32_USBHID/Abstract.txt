The HID project is a demo program for the STM32F103RBT6 
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs
  - 2 Push Buttons (S2,S3)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  MCBSTM32: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J1 to PD2 for debugging
